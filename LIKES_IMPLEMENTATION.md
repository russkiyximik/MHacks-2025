# Like Functionality Implementation Summary

## What was added:

### 1. Storage System (socialFeatures.js)
- Added `LIKES_KEY` constant for AsyncStorage
- Created likes data structure: `{ messageId: { count: number, likedBy: [userIds] } }`

### 2. Core Functions (socialFeatures.js)
- `getAllLikes()` - Get all likes data from storage
- `getLikesForMessage(messageId)` - Get likes info for specific message
- `hasUserLikedMessage(messageId)` - Check if current user liked a message
- `toggleMessageLike(messageId)` - Like/unlike a message
- `initializeMockLikes(messages)` - Generate mock likes for existing messages (0-7 likes per message)

### 3. UI Components (App.js)
- Added like button with heart emoji (🤍 for unliked, ❤️ for liked)
- Added like count display next to the heart
- Like button appears on all messages (both user's own and others')
- Like count updates in real-time when toggled

### 4. State Management (App.js)
- `likesData` - Stores likes information for all messages
- `userLikes` - Set of messageIds that current user has liked
- Updated `loadChatMessages()` to initialize mock likes and load user's like status
- Added `handleToggleLike()` function for UI interactions

### 5. Styling (App.js)
- `messageActions` - Container for action buttons
- `likeButton` - Styling for the like button
- `likeButtonText` - Text styling for like button
- `likeButtonActive/Inactive` - Different opacity states

## Features:
✅ Users can like/unlike any message in the chat
✅ Like count displays next to each message
✅ Visual feedback with heart emoji (filled/unfilled)
✅ Mock data generates 0-7 random likes for existing messages
✅ Likes persist in AsyncStorage across app sessions
✅ Real-time updates when liking/unliking messages
✅ Cannot like your own messages multiple times (same user ID handling)

## User Experience:
- Tap the heart icon to like/unlike a message
- Heart changes from 🤍 (white) to ❤️ (red) when liked
- Number next to heart shows total likes
- Works on both current user's messages and other users' messages
- Like status persists when app is restarted
